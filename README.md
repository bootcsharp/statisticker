# Compute Statistics

Here we compute statistics for a bunch of numbers.

## The task

The code is not complete and doesn't even compile.
Have a look at the tests to know our intention.
Design the return type accordingly.
You need to design a test for an error condition as well.

Take care not to leave behind any compiler warnings in your solution.
